    component both in isolation, and in composition.  To do that, we focus our
    reasoning principle on interfaces, by defining how their primitives shall be
    used in the one hand, and what to expect the result computed by “good”
    operational semantics (according to a certain definition of “good”). *)

(** * Definition *)

(** A specification dedicated to [i : interface] primilarly provide two
    predicates [requirements] and [promises].

    - [requirements] distinguishes between primitives that can be used (by an
      impure computation), and primitives that cannot be used.
    - [promises] specifies which guarantee can be expected from primitives
      results, as computed by a “good” operational semantics.

    Both [requirements] and [promises] models properties that may vary in time,
    e.g., a primitive may be forbiden at a given time, but authorized later.  To
    take this possibility into account, specifications are parameterized by what
    we have called a “witness.”  A witness is a term which describes the
    necessary information of the past, and allows for taking decision for the
    present.  It can be seen as an abstraction of the concrete state of the
    interface implementer.

    To keep this state up-to-date after each primitive interpretation,
    specifications also defines a dedicated function [witness_update]. *)

Record specs (i : interface) (Ω : Type) : Type :=
  { witness_update (ω : Ω) : forall (a : Type), i a -> a -> Ω
  ; requirements (ω : Ω) : forall (a : Type),  i a -> Prop
  ; promises (ω : Ω) : forall (a : Type), i a -> a -> Prop
  }.

Arguments witness_update [i Ω] (s ω) [a] (_ _).
Arguments requirements [i Ω] (s ω) [a] (_).
Arguments promises [i Ω] (s ω) [a] (_ _).

(** The most simple specification we can define is the one that requires
    anything both for the impure computations which uses the primitives of a
    given interface, and for the operational semantics which compute results for
    these primitives. *)

Definition const_witness {i} :=
  fun (u : unit) (a : Type) (e : i a) (x : a) => u.

Definition no_req {i Ω} (ω : Ω) (a : Type) (e : i a) : Prop := True.

Definition no_prom {i Ω} (ω : Ω) (a : Type) (e : i a) (x : a) : Prop := True.

Definition no_specs (i : interface) : specs i unit :=
  {| witness_update := const_witness
   ; requirements := no_req
   ; promises := no_prom
   |}.

(** A similar —and as simple— specification is the one that forbids the use of a
    given interface. *)

Definition no_use {i Ω} (ω : Ω) (a : Type) (e : i a) : Prop := False.

Definition forbid_specs (i : interface) : specs i unit :=
  {| witness_update := const_witness
   ; requirements := no_use
   ; promises := no_prom
   |}.

(** As we compose interfaces and operational semantics, we can easily compose
    specifications together, by means of the [specsplus] operator (denoted by
    [<.>] or [⊙]). Given [i : interface] and [j : interface], if we can reason
    about [i] and [j] independently (e.g., the requirements of [j] do not vary
    when we use [i]), then we can compose [speci : specs i Ωi] and [specj :
    specs j Ωj], such that [speci ⊙ specj] in a specification for [i ⊕ j]. *)

Definition specsplus {i j Ωi Ωj} (speci : specs i Ωi) (specj : specs j Ωj)
  : specs (i ⊕ j) (Ωi * Ωj) :=
  {| witness_update := fun (ω : Ωi * Ωj) (a : Type) (e : (i ⊕ j) a) (x : a) =>
                         match e with
                         | in_left e => (witness_update speci (fst ω) e x, snd ω)
                         | in_right e => (fst ω, witness_update specj (snd ω) e x)
                         end
  ;  requirements := fun (ω : Ωi * Ωj) (a : Type) (e : (i ⊕ j) a) =>
                       match e with
                       | in_left e => requirements speci (fst ω) e
                       | in_right e => requirements specj (snd ω) e
                       end
  ;  promises := fun (ω : Ωi * Ωj) (a : Type) (e : (i ⊕ j) a) (x : a) =>
                   match e with
                   | in_left e => promises speci (fst ω) e x
                   | in_right e => promises specj (snd ω) e x
                   end
  |}.

Declare Scope specs_scope.

Infix "<.>" := specsplus (at level 77, left associativity) : specs_scope.
Infix "⊙" := specsplus (at level 77, left associativity) : specs_scope.

Bind Scope specs_scope with specs.

(** Finally, and as an example, we define a specification for the interface
    [STORE s] we discuss in [FreeSpec.Core.Impure].  As a reminder, the
    interface is defined as follows:

<<
Inductive STORE (s : Type) : interface :=
| Get : STORE s s
| Put (x : s) : STORE s unit.
>>

    For [STORE s], the best witness is the actuall value of the mutable
    variable.  Therefore, the specification for [STORE s] may be [specs (STORE
    s) s], and the witness will be updated after each [Put] call.

<<
Definition store_update (s : Type) :=
  fun (x : s) (a : Type) (e : STORE s a) (_ : a) =>
    match e with
    | Get => x
    | Put x' => x'
    end.
>>

    Assuming the mutable variable is being initialized prior to any impure
    computation interpretation, we do not have any requirements over the use of
    [STORE s] primitives.  We will get back to this assertion once we have
    defined our specification, but in the meantime, we define its promises.

    The logic of these promises is as follows: [Get] is expected to produce a
    result strictly equal to the witness, and we do not have any promises about
    the result of [Put] (which belongs to [unit] anyway, so there is not much to
    tell).

<<
Inductive store_prom (s : Type) (x : s) : forall (a : Type), STORE s a -> a -> Prop :=
| get_prom (x' : s) (equ : x = x') : store_prom s x s Get x'
| put_prom (x' : s) (b : unit) : store_prom s x unit (Put x') b.
>>

    The actual specification can therefore be defined as follows:

<<
Definition store_specs (s : Type) : specs (STORE s) s :=
  {| witness_update := store_update s
  ;  requirements := no_req
  ;  promises := store_prom s
  |}.
>>

    Now, as we briefly mentionned, this specification allows for reasoning about
    an impure computation which uses the [STORE s] interface, assuming the
    mutable, global variable has been initialized.  We can define another
    specification that do not rely on such assumption, and on the contrary,
    requires an impure computation to initialize the variable prior to using it.

    In this context, the witness can solely be a boolean which tells if the
    variable has been initialized, and the [requirements] will require the
    witness to be [true] to authorize a call of [Get].

    This is one of the key benefit of the FreeSpec approach: because the
    specifications are defined independently from impure computation and
    interfaces, we can actually define several specifications to consider
    different set of hypotheses. *)

(** * Reasoning with Specifications

    ** Impure Computation Trustworthiness

    An impure computation [p] is said trustworthy wrt. a specification [c] in
    accordance to a witness [ω] when it only uses primitives of [i] which
    satisfies [c] requirements. *)

Inductive trustworthy_impure {i a Ω} (c : specs i Ω) (ω : Ω) : impure i a -> Prop :=

(** - Given a term [x], the computation [local x] is always trustworthy wrt. [c]
      in accordance to [ω], since it does not use any primitives. *)

| trustworthy_local (x : a)
  : trustworthy_impure c ω (local x)

(** - Given a primitive [e] and a continuation [f], if

      - [e] satisfies [c] requirements
      - [f] computations are trustworthy wrt. [c] in accordance to [ω'], where
        [ω'] is the witness after [e] interpretation

      then the impure computation [request_then e f] is trustworthy wrt. [c] in
      accordance to [ω]. *)

| trustworthy_request {b}
    (e : i b) (req : requirements c ω e) (f : b -> impure i a)
    (prom : forall (x : b),
        promises c ω e x -> trustworthy_impure c (witness_update c ω e x) (f x))
  : trustworthy_impure c ω (request_then e f).

(** As is, the definition of [trustworthy_impure] would force FreeSpec users to
    unfold any impure computations they may combine together with [bind].  For
    instance, proving a computation of the form [bind p (λ _, p)] is trustworthy
    would require to prove [p] is trustworthy twice, for two different
    witnesses.  Moreover, it could be challenging to know, when interactively
    writing the proof script, when “the first [p]” stops, and when “the second
    [p]” starts.

    We need a way to compose proofs about impure computations the same way we
    compose impure computations with [bind].  We do that with the
    [trustworthy_run] predicate, which describes the potential outcomes of a
    computation in terms of results and witnesses. *)

    which produces a term [y] and a witness [ω'], then there is a trustworthy

    We say [c] is correct wrt. [speci] (a specification for [i]) and [specj] (a
    specification for [i]) iff given primitives which satisfy the requirements of
    [speci], [c] will

    - use trustworthy impure computations wrt. [specj]
    - compute results which satisfy [speci] promises, assuming it can rely on a
      semantics of [j] which complies with [specj]

    The two witness states [ωi : Ωi] (for [speci]) and [ωj : Ωj] (for [specj]),
    and [st : s] the internal state of [c] remained implicit in the previous
    sentence.  In practice, we associate them together by means of a dedicated
    predicate [pred].  It is expected that [pred] is an invariant throughout [c]
    life, meaning that as long as [c] computes result for legitimate effects
    (wrt.  [speci] effects, the updated values of [ωi], [ωj] and [st] continue
    to satisfy [pred]. *)

(** * Tactics *)

(** The [impure] monad is an empty shell which brings structure and only
    that.  It is not relevant when it comes to verifying impure computations,
    and we provide a tactic called [prove_impure] to erase it while proving a
    given impure computation is trustworthy wrt. to a given specification. *)
