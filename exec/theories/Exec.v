(** * Extending FreeSpec.Exec *)

(** The FreeSpec.Exec plugin has been designed to be extensible, meaning it
    shall be easy for FreeSpec users to be able to provide handlers for their
    own interfaces. *)

(** ** By Means of OCaml plugins

    In FreeSpec, primitives are modeled with Coq constructors of an [interface]
    inductive type. FreeSpec.Exec allows to define so-called
    <<effectful_semantic>> for these constructors which aim to compute the
    related primitive results.

    The Ocaml type <<effectful_semantic>> is defined as follows:

<<
type effectful_semantic =
  Constr.constr list -> Constr.constr
>>

    If you are not familiar with Coq internals, <<Constr.constr>> is the
    representation of Coq terms. Therefore, an <<effectful_semantic>> is an
    Ocaml function which maps a list of Coq terms (the arguments of the
    primitives) to its result.

    For instance, if we consider the following interface:

<<
Inductive CONSOLE : interface :=
| WriteLine : string -> CONSOLE unit
| ReadLine : CONSOLE string.
>>

    Since <<Coq-8.10>>, it is required to manually register both the type of an
    interface and its constructors for plugins to easily interact with them. This is done
    with the [Register] command.

<<
Register <Coq Name> <Unique ID>.
>>

    The <<FreeSpec.Exec>> plugin expects the unique ID to be of the form <<<some
    path>.<Coq Name> >>for contructors and <<<some path>.type>> for the type. In
    the case of the <<CONSOLE>> interface, we could use:

<<
Register CONSOLE freespec.exec.console.type.
Register WriteLine freespec.exec.console.WriteLine.
Register ReadLine freespec.exec.console.ReadLine.
>>

    Then, one can implement two <<effectful_semantic>>: one for the constructor
    <<WriteLine>> and the other for the constructor <<ReadLine>>:

<<
let writeline = function
  | [str] -> print_bytes (bytes_of_coqstr str);
             coqtt
  | _ -> assert false

let readline = function
  | [] -> string_to_coqstr (read_line ())
  | _ -> assert false
>>

    There are several facts to explain.

    First, manipulating <<Constr.constr>> value manually shall not be required
    most of the time, since the FreeSpec.Exec plugin provides several helpers
    isomorphisms to turn Coq term into Ocmal values and vice-versa.
    Hence, <<bytes_of_coqstr>> translates a [string] term into a [bytes] value,
    while <<string_to_coqstr>> translates a Ocaml [string] value into a Coq
    [string] term.

    Secondly, it is the responsibility of plugin developers to ensure they
    consider the right number of arguments for their <<effectful_semantic>>. The
    <<WriteLine>> constructor has one argument, so the <<writeline>> Ocaml
    function only consider one-element lists. The <<ReadLine>> constructor has
    no argument, so the <<readline>> Ocaml function only handles the empty list.

    Thirdly, it is also the responsibility of plugin developers to forged a
    well-typed result for their primitives.

    Once the <<effectful_semantic>> have been defined, they need to be
    registered to FreeSpec.Exec, so that the plugin effectively use them. The
    <<Extends>> Ocaml module of FreeSpec.Exec provides a function to that hand:

<<
val register_interface :
  (* The base path we have chosen to register our interface. *)
     string
  (* A list to map each constructor of this interface
     to an effectfull semantic. *)
  -> (string * effectful_semantic) list
  -> unit
>>

    It shall be used as follows:

<<
let _ =
  register_interface
    "freespec.exec.console"
    [("WriteLine", writeline); ("ReadLine", readline)]
>>

    For a concrete example of the use of FreeSpec.Exec extensible feature,
    interested readers can have a look at the FreeSpec.Stdlib project.

(** ** By Means of Compoments *)

(** The second way to extend FreeSpec.Exec is to write handlers in Coq, in the
    form of FreeSpec compoments. This approach has an important advantage over
    writing an OCaml plugin: it is possible to verify a FreeSpec
    [component]. However, we forsee an impact over FreeSpec performances.

    The function [with_component] allows for locally providing a novel interface
    [j] in addition to an impure computation [p], by means of a FreeSpec
    component [c : compoment j ix s].  Two impure computations have to be
    provided: [initializer] to create the initial state of [c], and [finalizer]
    to clean-up the final state of [c] after the interpretation of [p]. *)

Fixpoint with_component_aux {ix j a} (c : component j ix) (p : impure (j ⊕ ix) a)
  : impure ix a :=
  match p with
  | local x => local x
  | request_then (in_left e) f =>
    c _ e >>= fun res => with_component_aux c (f res)
  | request_then (in_right e) f =>
    request_then e (fun x => with_component_aux c (f x))
  end.

     finalizer;

    let run := run_effect sem e in
