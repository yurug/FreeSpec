  <p>
    FreeSpec is a compositional reasoning framework for the Coq proof assistant.

    It aims at providing facilities to modularly specify and verify complex
    systems built with a collection of interconnected components.

  <p>
    Although FreeSpec remains a work-in-progress, efforts have been made to
    ensure interested users can already use it.
